# STM32F10x-ADC
Code for work with the analog sensors using the STM32. There are two example files:
- ADC-simple-one.cpp - One of the simpiest way to use the STM32F10x's ADC. 
- ADC-advanced-one.cpp - Example, which can help you to work with numerous of the analog sensors.

There are all configurations for the preprocessor and linker, so if you use STM32F10xMD-Value line with the ST-link and IAR as
an IDE you can just complie it and use.
